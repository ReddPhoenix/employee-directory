## **Project Link**
The app is deployed on GitHub Pages: [Employee Directory](https://reddphoenix.github.io/employee-directory/)
## **Description**
This app was created using React. The Employee Directory allows a user to sort an employee database in ascending/descending order by clicking on any of the column headings. The search function filters data according to user input across all columns. Employee data was created using the Mockaroo API. 

  ## **Demo**
  ![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReddPhoenix/employee-directory/main/public/assets/demo.gif)
 
 ## **Usage**
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information. 

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
